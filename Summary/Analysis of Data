Pymoli Data Analysis. 

In my review of this date set I have found may coorilations. The top 3 conclusions I have found are the following: 


1. Men are the top purchase in this game. Although women due spend a similar amount men have a 4x high ourchase count. 

2. People between the gae of 20-24 are significantly the highest purchase age group. This age group acount for close to 50% of the total players.

3. Final Crtic is the overall most popular item. This applys to both purchase count and purchase value.


Many more coorlinatoons can be found in this data set upon further review!
